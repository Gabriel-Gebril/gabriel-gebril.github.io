    "With a comically large bowl of cubed watermelon in one hand and a mouse in the other, 15-year-old Gabe booted up Lucas Pope’s _Papers, Please_. He found himself in the position of an inspector at an immigration checkpoint, letting in those who qualify and turning away those who don’t. He saw his family’s journey to Canada echoed in the plight of the virtual immigrants and the inspector’s trepidatious emigration. After finishing the game, he gained a teaching tool; something he could give his peers when they asked what it was like being forced to emigrate." That was the opening paragraph to my letter of intent to Brock's MA in Game Studies. Games hold a special place in my heart. I intend to study the part games have to play in anti-colonial struggle and build systems of liberation within the games industry and academia. Most of what I've worked on isn't availble to the public for one reason or another but you can check out this color matching game I made to teach people an intuitive understanding of the RGB color system <a href="../color-game.html" target="_blank">[by clicking here].</a>
