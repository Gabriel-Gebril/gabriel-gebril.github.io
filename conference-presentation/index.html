<p>We are going to be looking at the Palestinian struggle for liberation
to learn some lessons about resistance. What can we learn from this
ongoing anti-colonial process? What artifacts are generated in the
process, and how are they generated?</p>
<p>Let’s begin with a quote from Dr. Refaat Alareer, a prominent
Palestinian poet that was assinated by the israeli regime last year.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="the-power-of-imagination" class="slide level3">
<h3>The Power of Imagination</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>[Before] Palestinians can live in a free Palestine, they have to
create a free Palestine in their imagination through stories, films,
novels, and the arts <span class="citation"
data-cites="alareerIfMustPoetry2024">(Alareer &amp; Abulhawa, 2024, p.
xviii)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<aside class="notes">
<p>And as I’ll argue in this presentation also through games. Liberation
is a process, not an event. What better medium to model process than
games? Basically any medium that allows for a conversation between the
people and her future can be an instrument of liberation. Therefore, for
a culture of resistance to form, the people resisting need to envision a
future.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>I’m going to play a short segment of an interview with Ghassan
Kanafani (a Palestinian freedom fighter from the 60s) that does a good
job articulating why Palestinians have a conversation with the future
instead of a conversation with their oppressors.</p>

</figure>
<aside class="notes">
<p>That isn’t to say that Palestinians don’t learn about the culture of
their oppressor. In fact Kanafani himself wrote an extensive book on
Zionist Literature that was recently translated into English. As any
oppressed people will tell you, they know more about their oppressors
than the oppressors know about themselves.</p>
<p>Forging a culture of resistance is less about the embedded traits of
the people who resist, but are a product of the situation imposed on
them by those that wield the power. Therefore, it’s important for those
creating a culture of resistance to know about the culture of those who
seek to dominate them.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s the oppressor who decides what resistance even looks
like in the first place.</p>

<h3>Who Decides the Mode of Resistance?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Algerian’s criminality, his impulsivity, and the violence of his
murders are therefore not the consequence of the organization of his
nervous system or of characterial originality, but the direct product of
the colonial situation <span class="citation"

</blockquote>
<aside class="notes">
<p>In the 50s and 60s labour zionism (a secular so-called socialist
zionism) was the primary form of oppression for the Palestinian people.
At that time, the popular front for the liberation of Palestine (PFLP)
(a marxist organization) was the primary resistance organization.
Fast-forward to today, Zionism has taken on a primarily messianic
religious character and so to meet the moment the primary resistance org
is Ḥarakat al-Muqāwamah al-ʾIslāmiyyah (Islamic resistance movement or
HAMAS).</p>

<p>Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols and how they create

gestures.</p>
<p>According to <span class="citation"
data-cites="hawreliakSemioticsSocialJustice2020">Hawreliak &amp; Lemieux
(2020)</span>: “Videogames are uniquely situated to represent systemic
oppression and privilege through what Ian Bogost calls ‘procedural
rhetoric,’ i.e. the representation of systems through computational
media. The [high multimodality] of Videogames allows players to
experience and interact with systems of oppression and privilege in ways
that other media cannot”</p>

<p>Pictured here are some “revolutionary objects” in Palestinian culture
as described by <span class="citation"
data-cites="matarForgingRevolutionaryObjects2024">Matar &amp;
Tawil-Souri (2024)</span>. Each one of these objects was forged by the
struggle. Their use in the liberation struggle making them artifacts of
liberation. The stick brandished by Sinwar in his final moment (pictured
bottom left) is being connected to the staff of Moses (pbuh) on Arab
social media. Moses was a prophet shared by Muslims and Jews and the
story of Moses throwing his staff down was meant to teach us
courage.</p>
<p>In this way anti-colonial process creates symbols of resistance.</p>
<p>Games that seek to become media for social justice in the Palestinian
context must incorporate these revolutionary objects within their play.
How might we go about that?</p>
<p>(Describe each if time allows)</p>
<p>(Optional) If I must die, you must live to tell my story to sell my
things to buy a piece of cloth and some strings, (make it white with a
long tail) so that a child, somewhere in Gaza while looking heaven in
the eye awaiting his dad who left in a blaze– and bid no one farewell
not even to his flesh not even to himself– sees the kite, my kite you
made, flying up above and thinks for a moment an angel is there bringing
back love If I must die let it bring hope let it be a tale</p>

</figure>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Pictured is the book cover for “Beyond a Boundary” by CLR James. The
book is ostensibly about cricket and James’ life growing up in colonial
Trinidad, and demonstrates the connections between race, class, values,
and play. The British culturally cultivated play in order to further
their colonial rule over Trinidad.</p>
<p>Players learn about culture through engaging with games. In James’
case he was being taught British culture by way of engaging with
cricket. Passively through the environment and actively through the
rules and systems of the game.</p>
<p>While our goals are different, the tools of cultural transmission are
the same.</p>
<p>To that end for engagement to be successful in teaching culture it
needs to have 2 main features: 1. An appealing and meaningful
environment and; 2. A suited and intuitive interaction paradigm</p>

<p>Our brains release chemicals based on the environment we are in. When
we learn in the same environment we intend to use the skills in, we do
much better. Therefore, it’s important that whatever environment we want
to use a skill within, is emulated by our game.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Allow me to tell a controversial story. I did a year of elementary
school in Lebanon in 2005. The atmosphere was obviously tense and even a
2nd grader like myself could tell. Why? Because the older kids had
started to smuggle BB guns into school! New kid with the “American”
accent was going to get picked on obviously, so I was often shooting
practice. It got so bad that at one point the principal took pity on me
and gave me a BB gun he had confiscated from one of the kids. Once I was
no longer at such a disadvantage I remember having a bit of fun with the
whole situation. Although it was frowned upon by the adults, the kids
were forced by circumstance to learn about guns and warfare. We made a
game of it.</p>
<p>In 2006 Israel invaded Lebanon, and I was forced to leave. Now I
wonder if the kids who I played bb guns with are now members of
Hezbollah because of the Israeli invasion last year. What would you do
if a two ton bomb hit your school, killing your children? What would you
do if Israeli soldiers who have a systematic rape policy were besieging
your villages?</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>My research seeks to create cultural continuity in the hope that
Palestinian resistance culture can continue to grow and evolve. Right
now I’m looking into Egyptian stick fencing, which is surprisingly under
researched in English. It’s my hope that by connecting games across
history, the methodology for creating videogames of resistance will
become obvious (or at least more apparent).</p>
<p>I hope that one day Palestinian games can be like Stardew Valley in
Jaffa depicting Palestinians farming oranges on the land. That I don’t
have to talk about resistance and violence and can instead talk about
building and the future. Until then, I’ll keep researching ways we can
continue to create a culture capable of fighting colonization.</p>
