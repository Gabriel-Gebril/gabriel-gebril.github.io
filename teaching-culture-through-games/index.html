<aside class="notes">
<p>At this point, we are well aware of the synergistic relationship
between Games and Learning. Game can be used as tool for motivation and
generally fulfill that task quite well. This presentation is going to go
in a bit of a different direction. How can game themselves be part of
cultural transmission, irrespective of their motivational component.</p>
<p>According to <span class="citation"
data-cites="gol-guvenPlayFlowChildrens2017">Göl-Güven (2017)</span>
whether a society supports children’s play or not is an indicator of the
so-called “value of play.” She gives 3 basic levels of support:</p>
<ul>
<li>culturally curtailed play: play is not notably appreciated: some
games are discredited so that children do not play these games</li>
<li>culturally accepted play: play is seen as an activity that keeps
children out of the way</li>
<li>culturally cultivated play: play is accepted and the fact that
adults play with children is recognized as important</li>
</ul>
<p>She further goes on to talk about “cultural denial:” a phenomenon
where adults are unable to participate in children’s play due to the
constraints of maintaining the demanding pace of their own adult
existence, but also that of children’s play being seen as a waste of
time.</p>
<p>Basically, under capitalism, play has a fraught relationship with
culture. Any cultural practices that aren’t necessarily in line with the
capital mode of production are not allowed to be interacted or “played”
with. You’ll find that many games have an underlying logic that furthers
certain status quos.</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols and how they create
meaning. It explores how signs communicate both intentional and
unintentional messages in various forms, including language, images, and
gestures.</p>
<p>A lot of the job of cultural education is teaching about the
semiotics of a people/culture. Pictured here are some “revolutionary
objects” in Palestinian culture as described by <span class="citation"
data-cites="matarForgingRevolutionaryObjects2024">Matar &amp;
Tawil-Souri (2024)</span>. Each one has a story that is deeply embedded
Palestinian culture. For a game to teach about Palestinian culture it
would need to teach our semiotics.</p>
<p>If I must die, you must live to tell my story to sell my things to
buy a piece of cloth and some strings, (make it white with a long tail)
so that a child, somewhere in Gaza while looking heaven in the eye
awaiting his dad who left in a blaze– and bid no one farewell not even
to his flesh not even to himself– sees the kite, my kite you made,
flying up above and thinks for a moment an angel is there bringing back
love If I must die let it bring hope let it be a tale</p>

<h3>How Games Transmit Culture</h3>

</figure>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Pictured is the book cover for “Beyond a Boundary” by CLR James. The
book is ostensibly about cricket and James’ life growing up in colonial
Trinidad, and demonstrates the connections between race, class, values,
and play. The British culturally cultivated play in order to further
their colonial rule over Trinidad.</p>
<p>One key theme the book argues is that play/non-play don’t have clean
boundaries. At best, that boundary is porous, if it exists at all. The
cricket field, the game board, the video game, they invariably have
aspects of the “real world” embedded within them that passively teaches
those who play about this so-called “real world.”</p>
<p>Players learn about culture through engaging with these games. In
James’ case he was being taught British culture by way of engaging with
cricket. Passively through the environment and actively through the
rules and systems of the game.</p>
<p>For this engagement to be successful in teaching the culture it would
have had to have 2 main features: 1. An appealing and meaningful
environment 2. A suited and intuitive interaction paradigm</p>
<p>We will go over the passive and active transmission of culture as
well as these tenants of good engagement in the following slides.</p>

<h3>Passive Cultrual Transmission</h3>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Before I get into the nasty examples, let’s start off with a way this
can be used for good. Islamophobia is on the rise. Recently a woman
wearing a headscarf in Ajax was attacked and almost lit on fire by an
islamophobe. Ignorance is known to fuel hatred like this. I would argue
the active campaigns against the new Assassin’s Creed titles by the
usual suspects (racists, mysogynsts, etc) is a way to culturally
curtailed play of these games to prevent the culture embedded in these
games from spreading.</p>
<p>Before going into the more messy examples, let’s watch a light
hearted example.</p>
<p>This video shows Muslim call to prayer being played during the day
night cycle of Assasin’s Creed Mirage. As some in the class may know,
Muslims pray 5 times a day at specific times. The call to prayer is
played from in game Mosques at the proper times.</p>
<p>This is a background element of the game that does a lot to provide
the player some context about the world they’re currently occupying.</p>

<h3>James On the “Boundary”</h3>
<p>[As] soon as we stepped on to the cricket or football field, more
particularly the cricket field, all was changed. We were a motley crew.
The children of some white officials and white business men, middleclass
blacks and mulattos, Chinese boys… and some poor black boys who had won
exhibitions or whose parents had starved and toiled on plots of
agricultural land and were spending their hard-earned money on giving
the eldest boy an education <span class="citation"

<p>Our brain releases cocktails of chemicals depending on the
environment. This cocktail is so important that they can make the
difference between a drug user surviving a dose, vs overdosing, with the
same among of drugs. The closer the environment of learning is to the
environment the player will end up using that information in, the better
the learning outcomes.</p>
<p>CLR James was able to demonstrate how cricket’s embedded logic taught
Britain’s colonial subjects British tradition. Can yall think of any
other examples of games where the game’s environment (the field, the
board etc) teach us about the culture they come from?</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Then there is the process and systems. Rules and order. These aspects
of the game instill values, norms, etc…</p>
<p>I wrote an article (that I can share with those interested) about how
the Bonfires in Dark Souls are colonial outposts. This system of these
small outposts of so-called “civilization” between areas of “barbarism”
is, I argue, analogous to the system of settler colonialism.</p>

<p>The closer the interaction paradigm is to the desired performance,
the easier the learning will translate to the real world. It isn’t
enough to embed the logic into the game, you must find a way for the
embedded logic to make itself manifest on the world.</p>
