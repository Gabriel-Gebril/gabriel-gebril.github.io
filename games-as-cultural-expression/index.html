<h3>Land Acknowlegement</h3>
<aside class="notes">
First though I’d like to acknowledge the land on which we gather is the
traditional territory of the Hatiwendaronk, Anishinaabe including
Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, Haudenosaunee, and Wendat, many
of whom continue to live and work here today. This territory is within
the land protected by the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Agreement. I also
acknowledge that this land was forcefully taken from its original
stewards and that this land acknowledgement is just the first step in
our reconciliation. We stand firmly with all Indigenous peoples, past
and present, in their struggles against colonialism, wherever they are,
and trust in their stewardship of their traditional homelands.

<li><p>Serious games differ from common e-learning apps by their balance

importance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I don’t see any reason why this can’t apply to movies, books, and
the like. Perhaps games being what they are makes the distinction less
tangible, and so it has to be spoken about more specifically. Often
times it’s obvious when a book is “serious” or pure entertainment as
example.</p></li>
<li><p>The learning implements a pedagogical approach, by structuring
the educational content and organizing its presentation. That their
purpose is educational.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to interrogate this concept of “purpose.” Who gets to
decide the purpose? One might say the purpose of football is “just
entertainment,” I many argue otherwise. Can games that appear to be
“just entertainment” on the surface, be serious games in
disguise?</p></li>

<p>[Anti-colonialism] interrogates the power configurations embedded in
ideas, cultures, and histories of knowledge production, validation, and
use. It also examines our understanding of indigeneity, pursuit of
agency, resistance, and subjective politics (Foucault, 1983; Moore,
1997)</p>

discourse? Here specifically it’s an:</p>

<p>I bring this up because this is the discursive framework we will be
operating under in this seminar. Basically our discourse ought to
reflect the fact that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[There] is no such thing as self-professed impartiality, non
partisanship, and indifference; that discursive practices are never
neutral or apolitical and that historical accounts and narratives are
shaped and socially conditioned by particular interests, histories,
desires, and politics <span class="citation"

<p>We’re going break down a cultural classification system, and a
learning classification system. Hopefully by the end of this talk, we
will walk out understand what it is we are trying to express, and how
our expression can be effective.</p>
<p>First we have three main types of goals in learning: cognitive,
psychomotor and affective - cognitive is mental skills and intellectual
development - psychomotor is physical coordination and motor skills -
affective is emotional attitudes, values, and appreciation</p>
Keep this in mind as we discuss what components of culture we are

<p>The first context is static. Something setup in a physical location

<p>“Come and play” by Gemayzeh and Mar Mikhael <span class="citation"
data-cites="mullerArchitectureStudentsReflect2018">(Muller,
2018)</span></p>
<p>Using physical installations and performances by students, their
friends, and a small fleet of service taxi drivers, Gemayzeh and Mikhael
made a game revolving around the concept of “play as a survival
kit.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Groups of four viewers were ushered into a service taxi, which at
one point went down an impossibly narrow alley—with just centimeters to
spare on each side of the car—and stopped in front of a doorway where a
performer entered the already full taxi, forcing those in the back seat
to make room for another occupant.</li>
<li>At another stop on the route, the students constructed an elongated
cart covered in real grass with a person sunbathing on it, highlighting
the lack of public space in Beirut.
<ul>
<li>The cart even had a time-stamped parking ticket since it was in a
parking space.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In an attempt to draw attention to how little green space there is
for children to play in Beirut, they hung a tire swing over this small
patch of grass. Neighborhood children immediately came to play on the
swing, highlighting how these installations are very different than
classroom exercises since they necessarily involve​ interactions with the
public.</li>

<p>During the recent genocide war on Gaza, this platform received some
press coverage for it’s use in Palestine. LGBTQ Palestinians in Gaza
shared their last words amidst mass death. The digital hub became a last
resort for anonymous declaration of queer love and grief. <span

<p>This is the one we are most accustomed to I think. This is where a
game is made for engagement at home or in a classroom.</p>
<p>So many examples here. See the previous section for a lot more.</p>
<p>For this section I want to present a project that addresses the
critique I had in the last section.</p>
<p>Countless Palestinian Futures (CPF) is a discussion-based game that
creates tangible ideas around Palestinian futures. It centres
imagination as an educational tool to build ideas of liberation and
cultivate conceptual and material alliances between the very people who
are systematically denied their return.</p>

<p>For meaningful environment is can be difficult to show so instead let
me tell a story about walking to the gym during undergrad. (tell
story)</p>
<p>For Suited and intuitive interaction paradigms, learning outcomes are
improved when controllers are close to a task, and the environment of
play is close to the environment of application.</p>
<p>Where does genre fit into this discussion? The article asserts that
adventure games are particularly suited to implement the “learning by
doing” approach. Are some genres simply better than others when it comes
to learning outcomes?</p>
<p>Action games are the least represented category here.</p>
<p>The article argues that action games require accurate and quick moves
to perform tasks like shooting or avoiding obstacles, mechanics which
are hardly related to cognitive gain, and should therefore be relegated
to sub-tasks or mini-games for the sake of engagement.</p>
