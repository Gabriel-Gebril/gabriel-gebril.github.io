RegionalCouncillor Hailey Bateman put forward a motion that would see the regionoppose its use, and I was to speak in support of her motion (Sawchuk,2025). My delegation mostlyfocused on the colonial underpinnings of the housing crisis, how theregion refuses to truly reckon with that fact, and the culturalconsequences of not taking a firm stance against forced displacement(Waziruddin, 2025).While the motion technically passed, it was rendered toothless via anamendment spearheaded by Diana Huson. It’s no coincidence that DianaHuson and Matt Siscoe played key roles in suppressing the politicalrights of the Palestinian community last year (Iorfida,2024). When the communityrequested that the Niagara sign be lit in pan-Arab colours to honourthose murdered by the Israeli military, they pulled out every dirtytrick in the book to deny us fair treatment under the law. Similarly,it’s also no coincidence that Councillor Hailey Bateman was the one whomotioned to have the Palestinian community respected. These politicianshave constructed their identities in such a way that renders theirpositions on issues wholly predictable. For worse, or for better. SinceI’m not a politician in a liberal democracy, my identity doesn’t have toquantify or encapsulate itself for public consumption. However, as Iwill detail in this article, my identity—whether Muslim, researcher, orPalestinian in diaspora—shapes and is shaped by my politicalinteractions.Constructing Identity Through “Activism” and ResearchI’m not sure if I like the term “activist.” I don’t tend to call myselfone, nor do I particularly like when others attribute that label to myactions. From my perspective, that title is reserved for those who actwithin the status quo, and when someone deviates from it, they aretransformed from “activist” to “militant,” and criminalized just asquickly. The story of how my Ummah (the concept of a community ofbelievers) in general, and my family in particular have beencriminalized is out of scope, so for lack of a better term, I’ll labelmy actions “activism.” I engaged in this “activism” for a few keyreasons. The first is that I believe no one should remain silent whenhuman rights are being violated, and the notwithstanding clause is bydefinition only invoked when the already flimsy charter of rights andfreedoms is being violated. This belief comes from my identity as aMuslim. As such, I look to the teachings of our Prophet, may peace beupon him (PBUH), to guide my actions. In that tradition, I will shareone of the most widely quoted Hadiths (oral anecdotes) of the ProphetMohammed (PBUH): Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or he is an oppressedone. People asked, “O Allah’s Messenger! It is all right to help himif he is oppressed, but how should we help him if he is an oppressor?”The Prophet said, “By preventing him from oppressing others”(Mujahid, 1997, p. 362).I interpret this Hadith to mean that I’m obligated to fight oppressionfrom whatever angle my position affords me. The other reason ispositionality — as defined by the position one has chosen to adoptwithin a given project. This is a slight deviation from the concept ofpositionality in the article by Holmes(2020), sincewhile I am using it to encapsulate both my political action and myresearch, Holmes is specifically writing about researchers undertaking astudy. Politically, the position I decided to take here was to standwith Indigenous people, who constitute a disproportionately largeportion of those victimized by the housing system in the Niagara region.While 28% of the unhoused population is Indigenous (Start Me UpNiagara, 2025),they make up only 2.9% of the broader regional population (Governmentof Canada, 2020). Thissuggests that violating the human rights of the unhoused woulddisproportionately impact the Indigenous peoples in Niagara. But whatled me to interpret this as oppression? Holmes suggests that: Novice researchers should realize that, right from the very start ofthe research process, that their positionality will affect theirresearch and will impact on their understanding, interpretation,acceptance, and belief, or non-acceptance and disbelief of other’sresearch findings (p. 7).I knew that to be the case coming into my Master’s degree, since I wascommitted to centralizing the Palestinian struggle for liberation in allmy work (Gebril, 2024). My experience as aPalestinian forces me to see my plight reflected in the impact invokingthe notwithstanding clause would have on Indigenous communities. Thefamilial experience of forced displacement from Palestine during 1948(Pappé, 2006) in general, andmy forced displacement from Lebanon in specific (Nafaa,2008), compels me to interpretthis political moment as Indigenous people being forcibly displaced forno reason other than the comfort of White bourgeoisie settlers. I sawthis connection while applying for research grants last year. The grantproposal I ended up writing would have me looking at the various waysvideogames perpetuate the Canadian housing crisis via the reproductionof colonial rhetoric. It was the research I had already conducted forthat grant proposal that led to my interpretation, and my positionagainst the use of the notwithstanding clause.In this way, my position as a Muslim, and a member of the Palestiniandiaspora influenced my research, which, in turn, fed back into my“activism.” I expect this give and take will continue. For instance, thevideogame culture discussed by Paaßen et al.(2017) has clearly forged contemporarypolitics. That the Mayor of St. Catharines is a prolific Reddit user,whose base is composed of the same #GamerGate White men mentioned inthe article, speaks to that fact. When The Standard quotes me as“[accusing] councillors of spending their time on Reddit farminginternet points and wanting to look cool rather than resolving theproblem” (Sawchuk, 2025), I’mvery specifically addressing Matt and his neo-conservative supporters.That Paaßen et al. are hopeful the gamer stereotype can be diversifiedis of cold comfort. The fact that this group of neo-conservatives fromthe #GamerGate era have consolidated their political power worries methat it’s ‘too little, too late.’ The big question on my mind after thisexperience is: Given the position videogames occupy in the status quo,can they be used in mounting an effective resistance against it? Thedesire to explore this question is what inspired my presentation for theHumanities Graduate Students Symposium(2025), andas I continue to navigate this political landscape, I’m certain newintersections between the academic and the political will emerge.Conclusion: Impact and IdentityIt’s easy to get cynical when occupying those intersections. Bothacademia and politics can feel like making tiny steps on the shouldersof giants, and like there is no end in sight. Here again, my Deen (wayof life or “religion”) provides me with meaning for continued action: The Prophet (PBUH) said, ‘If the (signs of the) Hour [(theapocalypse)] appear and one of you has a palm-cutting in his handsand it is possible to plant it before the Hour (actually) comes, heshould plant it’ (al-Bukhari, 2014, p.318).While the tafsir (commentary) by al-Bukhari emphasizes the benefit ofplanting trees, and there is certainly a lot of evidence for thatinterpretation, my interpretation of the anecdote is that of acting inthe face of apocalypse. That one must strive towards a goal even in theface of disaster, perhaps specifically because a disaster is coming.This meaning is what allows me to continue on this path, despite thehardship, and the perceived lack of impact. It’s the painkiller thatkeeps this process manageable (Marx,1970).I’ve spent much of this article embedding my experience in Islamictradition and anecdote. However, the primary political current amongPalestinians in the diaspora is the Marxist-Leninist tradition;therefore, much of my political education comes from that tradition.Marx (1970), Lenin(2010), and Kanafani(2022) are the usual suspects inpolitically active diaspora circles. In that tradition my interactionwith the local legislature is as Marx described: That all as individuals want to participate integrally in thelegislature is nothing but the will of all to be actual (active)members of the state, or to give themselves a political existence, orto prove their existence as political and to effect it as such. Thefact, therefore, that civil society invades the sphere of legislativepower en masse, and where possible totally, that actual civil societywishes to substitute itself for the fictional civil society of thelegislature, is nothing but the drive of civil society, to give itselfpolitical existence, or to make political existence its actualexistence (p. 118).My experience isn’t embedded in one tradition or the other. Mymetaphysics and my politics do not have a such a dividing line. Duringthe apocalypse in Gaza brought on by American bombs (Abdo,2024), it was prayer and theUmmah that kept me sane. Neither political action nor research can beeffectively conducted if one is overwhelmed by the pain of these crimes.Therefore, in my case, the metaphysical was what allowed me to engage inthe political. Some may view my Deen as being at odds with my politicaleducation, especially considering Marx’s (1970) critiques of religion.While I’m sure scholars and activists have opined about the intersectionof religion and Marxism, anecdotally, that has never been much of acontradiction in my circles. In my community — regardless of one’s“secondary identities” — we continue fighting for what’s right, despiteour setbacks or failures, because that’s who we are (Janet,2023).References:Abdo, N.

Each time I attempt to make to myself a home, I am confronted with this stark reality. In other words, the struggle exists wherever a Palestinian does, and we must never lose sight of this truth. This is why I declare, through this article, that the Palestinian cause will always remain central to my work—games are simply the medium I have chosen. If all I had was a stick, then a stick would be my medium of choice.The Palestinian CauseIt’s worth going into the specifics of what I mean when I say “the Palestinian cause.” To do that, we must first understand the enemy of the Palestinian people. The roots of this enemy lie in Europe, where a problem of pervasive Jew hatred—known in German as Judenhass and later renamed by Nazis to anti-Semitism— had taken hold. While the term “anti-Semitism” is widely used, I prefer not to adopt terminology coined by Nazis. For clarity, I will refer to this hatred simply as Judenhass or Jew hatred throughout this article.Zionism was originally a Christian Evangelical project. Through many years of work an alliance was eventually forged between the Evangelical Christians and a few Anglo Jewish aristocrats. The British then attempted to solve their hatred of the Jewish people by exporting their Judenhass as a colonial project to the land of Palestine. This is explicitly shown in the Balfour declaration, penned by Arthur Balfour; a person with profound Judenhass. This idea to ethnically cleanse Europe of the Jews and ghettoize them in Palestine is known as Zionism. The history I’ve outlined here can be found in many of Ilan Pape’s works on the subject but for a quick read to prove my statements you can read the article he did for the Palestine Chronicle here. This ghettoization has a lot of moving parts, chief among them though is the colonization of the land. This might take many forms, but however you slice it, it’s predicated on the violent extermination of my people in order for the Zionists to build this new European civilization both in Europe and in Palestine.An ideology rooted in the destruction of the Palestinian people is, obviously, the enemy of the Palestinian cause. While identifying the enemy is essential, a cause also requires a strategy to fight said enemy. After years of struggle and experimentation, Palestinians have realized that the solution lies in something fundamental: unity. This concept, often referred to as “unity of the fields,” asserts that any tool capable of dismantling Zionism is a valid one. If all a person has is a stick, then that stick becomes their tool of resistance. Other tools, of course, may be more effective or suited to particular contexts, and it is critical to recognize and prioritize the best tools for each field of struggle.The second aspect of unity is the unity of the people. One day, apartheid in Palestine will fall, and for true liberation to take root, all its people—Muslim, Christian, Jewish, or Druze—must be able to live dignified and just lives. This vision of unity is only achievable through justice, which must remain a primary guiding principle. However, the broader discussion of justice is beyond the scope of this article.In conclusion, the Palestinian cause is fundamentally straightforward. The enemy is Zionism—a destructive ideology that aims to isolate and ghettoize the Jewish people by colonizing the land of Palestine. The solution lies in unity: unity of the fields to dismantle Zionism and unity of the people to ensure a future where all can live with dignity and justice.Why care?The history of Zionism has resulted in a vast Palestinian diaspora, of which I am a part. Some might question why I care so deeply: “Jibreel, you live in Canada. How does this affect you? Why not just keep your head down, get a good job, and forget about Palestine?” This suggestion is ludicrous on the face of it—after all, I have family in Palestine whom I care about deeply. But beyond that, the statement is fundamentally flawed. Zionism is not merely a force that robbed me of my rights in the past; it is an ideology that continues to strip me of my rights, regardless of where I live.In 2005, my family moved to Lebanon. By 2006, my mom had just secured a good job, my Arabic was improving, and we were beginning to rebuild our lives. Then, everything changed when the fire nation attacked. At just seven years old, I was packed onto a plane to Canada alone because Zionists decided it was time to expand the ghetto once again. Lebanon was invaded yet again by Zionist forces. My mom and I should have had the right to live a dignified life in Lebanon back then, just as her father before her should have had the right to live a dignified life in Yaffa, Palestine, before that.The Zionist project relies on creating and maintaining systemic inequalities to sustain its colonial framework. To convince Jewish people in Palestine that their ghetto is not a ghetto, they are granted privileges far above the native Palestinian population. Only the Jewish natives in Palestine were afforded the opportunity to assimilate into this European Jewish upper class. Meanwhile, Muslim, Christian, and Druze Palestinians who remained in the territories occupied in 1948 were—and continue to be—excluded, facing discriminatory laws that restrict their freedoms. This denial of rights is not limited to Palestinians within occupied territories; it extends to the diaspora, even outside the Arab world.The stronghold of Zionism lies outside Palestine, particularly on Turtle Island, where the American state funnels weapons into the hands of settlers. This far-reaching apartheid system denies Palestinians in the diaspora the ability to exercise even symbolic acts of dignity. For instance, in early 2024, the Palestinian community in Niagara requested that the Niagara sign be illuminated in Pan-Arab colours to show solidarity with those being massacred and starved in Palestine. This simple request was denied.For this multilayered apartheid system to function, the rights of Palestinians everywhere must be stolen. This reality makes it impossible to separate our individual dignity from the collective rights of our people. Our stolen freedoms are a constant reminder that the struggle for justice and equality is not confined to Palestine—it exists wherever Palestinians do.Why Games?My first real introduction to video games came in 2005 when my aunt gave me her old Game Boy Walkman after we moved to Lebanon. That Game Boy not only helped me through tough times but also—funnily enough—taught me how to read. While the primary axis of the Palestinian cause is armed struggle (a duty recognized by the UN), my role is one of cultural support infrastructure. The true heroes are those living under occupation, writing a story of resilience and heroism, often with their own blood, every single day.Basil Al-Araj once wrote, “Just as the Zionist journalist is a fighter, so are you.” By that same logic, just as Neil Druckmann is a soldier in the cultural arena, so am I. It’s a remarkably isolating battlefield. There isn’t a single games program in Palestine—except for one in occupied Yaffa, which most Palestinians cannot access due to apartheid.When I worked at Tesla in the American State, I was part of the support engineering team—a role that reflects my broader philosophy. Even my name, Jibreel, carries the legacy of the angel Gabriel, who served as a messenger and supporter to the Prophet (PBUH). While I can never truly aspire to live up to the name of an angel, I strive to embody their spirit. As an anti-colonial games scholar, my role is to create space for those fighting colonialism and to use games as a platform for the anti-colonial struggle.My grandmother, may Allah (SWT) have mercy on her soul, was a proud Gazan and an educator. I pray that I can honour her legacy by contributing to the development of games education in Gaza once this genocidal war comes to an end." } ]
